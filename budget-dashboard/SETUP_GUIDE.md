# Budget Dashboard - Setup Guide

## 🎉 First Time Setup

When you first load the dashboard, you'll see a **Welcome Setup Modal** with two tabs:

### Tab 1: Account Balances 💳

**All values default to $0** - Enter your actual current balances:

**Option 1: Manual Entry**
- **Checking Balance** - Your current checking account balance
- **BofA Statement Balance** - Current statement balance on BofA card
- **BofA 2 Statement Balance** - Current statement balance on BofA 2 card
- **Chase Statement Balance** - Current statement balance on Chase card
- **Pending Charges** (Optional) - Any pending charges on each card

**Option 2: Load from Excel** 📄
- If you have the `budget.xlsx` file, click **"Load from Excel File"** button
- This will auto-populate all balance fields from the Excel file
- Useful for initial setup if you already have data in the spreadsheet

### Tab 2: Regular Expenses 📊
Set your consistent income and expenses:
- **Bi-Weekly Paycheck** - Your paycheck amount (every other Thursday)
- **Monthly Rent** - Your rent amount (due on 23rd)
- **Weekly Spending** - Average weekly spending

## 💾 Data Storage

All your settings are **automatically saved to your browser's localStorage**:
